# Authentication

This folder contains all configuration related to authentication. The application has two kinds of authentication:

- **API key**: Used by public bodies to publish and manage their own data.
- **Username/password**: Users (the public) can create private accounts where they can handle things like access requests and saved searches.

In the future, employees will be able to authenticate and send requests on behalf of a public body using [Ansattporten](https://docs.digdir.no/docs/idporten/oidc/ansattporten_guide.html).
